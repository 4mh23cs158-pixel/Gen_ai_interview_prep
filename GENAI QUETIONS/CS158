#  1. What are Transformers and why are they important in Generative AI?
Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI. They were introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.
Transformers are important in generative AI because they enable models to understand and generate human-like text by using self-attention mechanisms. This allows them to capture long-range dependencies in text, making them highly effective for tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and text generation. The ability of transformers to process and generate coherent and contextually relevant text has made them a cornerstone in the development of advanced generative AI models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
# 2. What are some popular Transformer-based models?
BERT (encoder-only)
GPT series (decoder-only)
T5 (encoder-decoder)
RoBERTa, XLNet, BART — variants with architectural improvements
# 6. What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that has been trained on a vast amount of text data to understand and generate human-like language. LLMs are typically based on the Transformer architecture and have a large number of parameters, often in the billions, which allows them to capture complex patterns in language. These models can perform a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. Examples of LLMs include GPT-3, BERT, and T5. The size and complexity of LLMs enable them to produce highly coherent and contextually relevant text, making them powerful tools for various applications in natural language processing.
